  <title>According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygggcqKmUts">bee</a> should be a able to fly. It's wings are too small to get it's fat little body off the groud. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygggcqKmUts">bee</a>, of course, flies anyway because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygggcqKmUts">bees</a> don't care what humans think is impossible</title>

    <p>Barry! Breakfast is ready! Coming! Hang on a second. Hello?
    <lb>
    <p>Barry?
    <lb>
    <p>Adam?
    <lb>
    <p>Can you believe this is happening?
    <lb>
    <p>I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp.
    <lb>
    <p>Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.
    <p>Sorry. I'm excited.
    <p>Here's the graduate.
    <p>We're very proud of you, son.
    <p>A perfect report card, all B's.
    <p>Very proud.

    <p>Ma! I got a thing going here.
    <p>You got lint on your fuzz.
    <p>Ow! That's me!
    <p>Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
    <p>Bye!
    <p>Barry, I told you,
    <p>stop flying in the house!
    <p>Hey, Adam.
    <p>Hey, Barry.
    <p>Is that fuzz gel?
    <p>A little. Special day, graduation.
    <p>Never thought I'd make it.
    <p>Three days grade school,
    <p>three days high school.
    <p>Those were awkward.
    <p>Three days college. I'm glad I took
    <p>a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
    <p>You did come back different.
    <p>Hi, Barry.
    <p>Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
    <p>Hear about Frankie?
    <p>Yeah.
    <p>You going to the funeral?
    <p>No, I'm not going.
    <p>Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
    <p>Don't waste it on a squirrel.
    <p>Such a hothead.
    <p>I guess he could have
    <p>just gotten out of the way.
    <p>I love this incorporating
    <p>an amusement park into our day.
    <p>That's why we don't need vacations.
    <p>Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
    <p>under the circumstances.
    <p>Well, Adam, today we are men.
    <p>We are!
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygggcqKmUts">Bee</a>-men.
    <p>Amen!
    <p>Hallelujah!
