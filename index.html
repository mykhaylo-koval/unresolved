      <p>So I imagine we all have things that <b><i><u>frustrate</u></i></b> us, I'll share mine!
      <p>My first is why does your body think <code>stubbing yout toe</code> will kill you?<sub>Like</sub>Wh<sup>at</sup>
      <p class=i>What about inconsistent and overly dramatic text?
      <h2>Here is a list of things I despise</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Blatant historical misconceptions</li>
        <li>People that think they know what they are talking about but actually don't and act like they know everything</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">When this happens</a></li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Here are a few others that are listed in a less orderly fashion</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Stepping on a lego or other small and sharp toy</li>
          <ul>
            <li>WHo doesn't?</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Also Boxes of Chocolate, I like chocolate, but boxes of chocolate try too hard to be quirky and come up with absolutely horrid flavors
          <ul>
            <li>Looking at you Jakobsen</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
      <dl>
        <dt>And don't even get me started on the hate that Comic Sans gets</dt><dd>It is a font ment for comics, not resumes you low IQ individual
